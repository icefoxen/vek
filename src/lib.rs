//! Generic 2D-3D math swiss army knife for game engines, with SIMD support and focus on convenience.
//!
//! See [the wiki](https://github.com/yoanlcq/vek/wiki) for an overview, FAQ, guides, and other info.
//!
//! This crate is still in its beta days!
//! The public API is quite close to being stable, but it hasn't been battle-tested enough.
//! Issues and bug reports are very welcome!
//!
//! # Cargo features
//!
//! - `vec8`, `vec16`, `vec32`, `vec64`, `rgba`, `rgb`, `uvw`, `uv`
//!   Enable these types.
//!   Other types are always enabled for the sake of doc-tests.
//! - `repr_simd` enables Nightly Rust's `repr_simd` and `simd_ffi` features, and unlock
//!   SIMD versions of all appropriate types (though `repr_simd` modules).
//!   On Stable, this feature has no effect.
//! - `serde` makes vectors and matrices derive `Serialize` and `Deserialize`.
//! - `image` makes color vectors implement the `Pixel` trait from the `image` crate.
//! - `x86intrin` enables x86 intrinsics through the `x86intrin` crate. `vek` doesn't directly
//!   depend on it because it won't compile on Stable and there's no way (as of this writing)
//!   to selectively depend on a crate based on the `rustc` version, not even via build scripts.
//!
//! # `#![no_std]`
//! This crate is `#![no_std]`.
